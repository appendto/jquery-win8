jQuery for Windows 8
====================

With the recent release of Windows 8 many developers have eagerly set out to create jQuery-enhanced applications for Windows 8. Unfortunately, all of these individuals quickly learned that jQuery and Windows 8 initially suffer a bit of friction when brought together.

Faced with this issue, appendTo is pleased to release a custom copy of jQuery that will play nicely in Windows 8. Just download it, include it in your project, and you'll be up and running.

To ensure the project's direction was carefully planned, appendTo communicated with the jQuery team routinely to address any concerns about modifying some aspects of jQuery (or its Unit Tests) to improve compatability with Windows 8.

Given that this is a preview and you may come across issues in your own projects, we would like to encourage you to freely submit issues and feedback here on GitHub. We will do our best to answer your concerns in a timely manner, and resolve issues as quickly as possible.

Please note that in order to get the best experience with jQuery and Windows 8 you'll need more than a modified library, you will also need an understanding of basic security concerns in the Windows 8 environment. Many of these concerns are with how you, the developer, use `$.html()` (and other similar methods). Please see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh465388.aspx for further details.
